## Description

I started this project with the intention of building a back-end application that will allow the user to access an employee database and update it as well. I learned a lot about using MySQL and how to link it to the terminal with MySQL2. You are able to create departments, roles, and employees as much as you want and you are also able to delete any of them as well. With each role they are assigned a department and also a salary. There are many options that you can choose from in the terminal to get the data that you want.
